So what are the benefits of being a TA? 

There's certainly a lot of work that can be put into being a TA, but what are the benefits? 

[NEXT SLIDE]

Some of them would be boosting your own skills.

There's a whole range of skills that you would develop as a TA. 

One is your coding skills, since the process of explaining how to code to other people solidifies your own understanding of that coding process.

There's the collaboration component. 

There is this idea that coding is all about doing things individually; staying up all night, drinking lots of coffee.

Actually I would argue, as many others do, that it's a lot more about collaboration; being able to communicate effectively with others is absolutely essential.

And again being a TA is all about collaboration and so your collaboration skills will improve. 

There's using all the online tools.

We might take these for granted to an extent but practice with different kinds online chat and asynchronous forum's and all the hangout stuff from Google; screen share etc. will improve your online tech skills.

As you know you're working with a team of TA's and students whicih can help develop your team skills.

And of course all the things from the course such as Software Engineering, Agile development and so on. 

Particularly to the extent that you get involved in projects with students and the Agile Ventures projects that we have going on in the background 

There's also the conflict resolution skills you'll developing when students are getting at each others throats, or event other TA's getting at each others throats :-)

Helping to resolve those conflicts is something you can put on your resume.

There's the experience of working with remote developers from all around the world.  We're overwhelmed by all the different nationalities and spoken languages that we have represented in our community.

It really is a fantastic environment in which to show how you can collaborate with an international distributed team.

So there's all that benefit in potentially boosting your skills.

And not only that we've got certificates too!

These are the official engineering software as a service text books certificates also backed by AgileVentures.

We've got an example of the level 1 certificates there so you'll get one of these for completing this course.

You'll get the level 2 certificate if you participate as a TA in the 169.1 course and do ... a sufficient level of student supporting activity each week staying with us each week by week over the seven or so weeks of that course.

And if you do the same thing again in the 169.2 course then you can get a level 3 certificates and these are all things that go into your portfolio.

Having a portfolio, a collection of your projects and achievements is important for your future job and university applications. 

You'll be able to add to your portfolio that you've been a teaching assistant for the for the 169 Engineering Software as a Service course; that you've completed this course and gained these certificates.

There's also the projects that you work on as part of this which could also go into your portfolio as well to the extent that you're working with students on projects and so on.

This is also in a part of the Agile development experience particularly as you get involved in Agile Ventures projects, since as you know Agile Ventures is a project incubator for open source projects.

The big thing really is about giving back to the community.

It's been fantastic the last few years as many leading universities have made lots of their learning materials and courses available for free.

I think pretty much everyone agrees this has made the world a bit of a better place.

So by giving back to the community you could help in the process of making this world one in which education is available to everyone without hindrance.

Also you get really big satisfaction from helping other people

Some people say that so it's becoming a star, we're all stars you know, we're all radiating the light of human compassion.

It's that connection with people and helping other people that's makes things worth while really. 

So I'm looking forward to seeing you in the rest of the course and hopefully as TAs in the MOOC or participants in Agile Ventures.
